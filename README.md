<!-- Competitive Analysis -->
## Competitive Analysis

### SWOT Analysis
#### Strengths

Does Not Require Specific Equipment:
* Fitness+ does not necessitate the purchase of proprietary equipment, unlike some competitors, making it more accessible to a broader audience.

Focused Classes, Not Generalized:
* The app offers specialized classes, providing a more targeted and personalized workout experience for users interested in strength training and personalized plans.

Lower Price Than Most Competitors:
* With a subscription cost of $8.99 per month (or $5.99 per month with an annual subscription), Fitness+ is more affordable than many competitors, making it an attractive option for cost-conscious consumers.

#### Weaknesses

No Live Classes:
* Fitness+ lacks live classes, which are popular among users who seek real-time engagement and motivation from instructors.

Newer App, Less Recognizable:
* As a newer entrant in the market, Fitness+ lacks the brand recognition of more established competitors, potentially making it harder to attract new users.

#### Opportunities

Growing Industry with Declining Revenue for Legacy Companies:
* The fitness subscription industry is expanding, while revenue for some legacy companies is declining. This creates an opportunity for newer and smaller companies like Fitness+ to capture a larger market share.

Negative Connotation of MLM Structure for Beach App:
* The MLM structure of Beach App may alienate a segment of potential customers, presenting an opportunity for Fitness+ to attract users looking for a more straightforward subscription model.

Strength-Focused Niche:
* Many competitors focus primarily on cardio workouts, with strength training as a secondary component. By specializing in strength workouts, Fitness+ can carve out a niche market and appeal to users specifically interested in this type of exercise.

Shift Away from Expensive Equipment and Subscriptions:
* With the rising cost of living, consumers may move away from expensive equipment and high-cost subscriptions offered by companies like Cycle App and Treadmill App. Fitness+'s affordable pricing and no-equipment model could become increasingly appealing.

#### Threats

Potential All in One-Cycle App Acquisition:
* Rumors of All in One purchasing Cycle App pose a significant threat, as All in One already offers a highly comparable product with a vast user base and ecosystem. Such an acquisition could consolidate market power and reduce Fitness+'s competitive edge.

Popularity of Cardio and Boutique Fitness:
* Cardio and boutique fitness classes remain very popular. The strength-focused approach of Fitness+ might limit its overall potential market, especially if consumers continue to favor cardio-based workouts.

#### Statistical Significance:

Standard error and a Z-score were calculated to determine the statistical significance of the difference in conversion rates between the control and test groups.

$se = \sqrt{(ControlConversionRate*{(1-ControlConversionRate) \over ControlClickThrough})+(TestConversionRate*{(1-TestConversionRate) \over TestClickThrough})}$ 

Standard Error: 0.000686004

$Z-Score = {(TestConversionRate - ControlConversionRate) \over se}$

Z-score: 11.54118114

The results show that the test campaign achieved a conversion rate of 7.11%, compared to 6.32% for the control group. The Z-score of 11.54 indicates a highly significant difference, suggesting that the changes implemented in the test campaign had a substantial positive impact on conversions.

<!-- Conclusion -->
## Conclusion

This market research and competitive analysis report for Fitness+ has provided valuable insights into the current landscape of the fitness subscription service industry and identified key areas for growth and improvement. By leveraging the A/B testing data, we have been able to assess the effectiveness of various marketing strategies and provide data-driven recommendations.

Our analysis revealed that Fitness+ has several strengths, including its affordability, specialized strength-focused workouts, and the absence of required proprietary equipment, which makes it accessible to a broader audience. However, the app's lack of live classes and its relative newness in the market pose challenges that need to be addressed.

The A/B test results showed a significant improvement in conversion rates when the marketing campaign emphasized personalized plans, affordability, and accessibility. This highlights the potential for Fitness+ to increase its market share by focusing on these areas in future campaigns.

The competitive analysis identified major players like Cycle App, All in One App, Treadmill App, Beach App, and Globo Gym App. While these competitors have their own strengths, they also present opportunities for Fitness+ to differentiate itself, particularly in the niche of strength-focused training.

### Notes and limitations: 
All companies and related data in this report are fabricated. In particular the financial data of the competitors and the A/B test dataset were randomly generated for use in this project. The results and conclusions shouls not be applied to any real world scenario without performing this analysis again with real data and companies.
