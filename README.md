<!-- Summary -->
## Summary

This report presents a comprehensive market research and competitive analysis for a leading fitness subscription service, aiming to optimize marketing strategies and increase market share. Using A/B Testing, we evaluated various marketing changes and their impact on conversion rates. The analysis revealed a statistically significant increase in conversions from 6% to 7% in the test group, demonstrating the effectiveness of the tested marketing change.

Key competitors in the fitness subscription market, were analyzed to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and marketing strategies.

Our recommendations include implementing the successful marketing change from the A/B test across all users, exploring additional A/B tests to further optimize marketing strategies, and leveraging personalized content to enhance customer engagement. These strategies are expected to improve market share and competitive positioning in the rapidly growing fitness subscription market.

<!-- Methodology -->
## Methodology

The A/B test dataset comprises randomly generated data for both a control and a test marketing campaign, representing website traffic and new subscriptions for the Fitness+ App during June 2024. The dataset includes daily counts for impressions, click-throughs, and new subscriptions for each campaign.

The A/B test data will be analyzed using Excel and Tableau to determine conversion rates and assess the statistical significance of the results between the two campaigns.

Additionally, a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis will be conducted using key competitors' products and publicly available financial data.
